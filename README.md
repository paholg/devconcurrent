**NOTE:** This is new, experimental software. Use at your own risk. It's still
undergoing rapid breaking changes; expect this to slow down once above version
0.1.0, and to mostly stop at 1.0.0.

With devconcurrent, you get easy setup and full control of multiple development
environments at the same time via [git worktrees](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree)
and [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). The devcontainer management works
whether or not you use VS Code.

The short pitch:

* Never `git stash` again when interrupted mid-task.
* Never worry about database migrations messing up your DB state.
* Run as many AI agents as you want without worrying about them getting in yours
  or eachother's way.
* Easily access your containers by URL, and never worry about port conflicts again.

Run `dc up foo` to get:

* A new worktree, `foo`, with its own, isolated devcontainer stack (hereafter
  referred to as a "workspace").
* A DNS server and HTTP proxy, so you can view your app at
  `https://foo.app.test` and reach your database at `foo.postgres.test`.
* Autopopulated environment variables, so just being in the directory is enough
  to have `DATABASE_HOST=foo.postgres.test` set.

Enter the devcontainer with `dc x`, inspect your workspaces with `dc status` and
clean them up with `dc destroy`. Work on the host or inside the container,
whichever you prefer.
